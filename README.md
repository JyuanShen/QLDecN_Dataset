# QLDecN
 We propose a SAR Radio Frequency interference detection network (QLDecN) combined with statistical histogram characteristics to detect the distribution of unintentional interference in the quick-looks (i.e. preview images) of Sentinel-1 SLC products.
## Dataset
 We selected 50 SLC product preview images from the Sentinel website, and used data augmentation methods such as cropping and flipping to cut the size to 256 Ã— 256. The expanded dataset contains 7580 images in each of two categories, divided into training and testing sets in a 4:1 ratio. This dataset can be used for training and validation of the QLDecN model.

 The download link of the dataset will be updated later (accessed on December 2024).
